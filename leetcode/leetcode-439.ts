  // "current" ternary expression. Initially this is `expr` in its entirity, but
  // after we consider the current expressions "?" character, find the index of
  // it's matching colon ":", and evalute the boolean in the condition spot;
  // we'll restrict the `lEdge` and `rEdge` to reflect the next ternary
  // expression we have to evaluate, deeper within.

    // expression since a ternary expression in this case is at least 5
    // characters long. Now we want to find the index `idx` where there is a
    // colon that matches the ternary expression's question mark.

    let cCount: number = 0;
    let idx: number = lEdge + 1; // initialized to the first position "?" exists.

    // Now we check the value in the condition slot of the ternary expression.
    // This will help us restrict `lEdge` and `rEdge` to the next ternary
    // expression we'll evaluate in the next tick of the loop.
